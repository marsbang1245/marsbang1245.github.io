            <h2>History of Olives</h2>
            <p>Fossil evidence indicates the olive tree had its origins 20–40 million years ago in the Oligocene, 
                in what now corresponds to Italy and the eastern Mediterranean Basin. Around 100,000 
                years ago, olives were used by humans in Africa, on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, for fuel 
                and most probably for consumption.</p>

                List of Olive Varieties</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Mission. This is the American olive, the one from the can. Mission accounts for half the olives grown in California (which grows 95 percent of U.S. olives).</li>
        <li>Niçoise. Egg-shaped and shades of purple, this mild French olive often finds a place in salads and tapenades.</li>
        <li>Cerignola. This olive from Italy's far south is large and bulbous with thick, meaty flesh. It comes in green, bright red, deep purple, and black.</li>
        <li>Moroccan-salt cured. Wrinkled and pure black, Moroccan salt-cured olives come with a long note of salt, nuanced flavor, and unexpected tenderness.</li>
        <li>Kalamata. Oval-shaped and dark purple, this olive has strong salinity. It famously appears in Greek salads.</li>
        <li>Arbequina. Pressed into some of the world's great olive oil, this round Spanish olive is also commonly eaten as a table olive.</li>
        <li>Castelvetrano. Usually a vibrant green, this Sicilian olive has thin-yielding flesh, minimal salt, and deep flavor—one of many perfect olives.</li>
    </ul>

            <h2>Uses of Olives</h2>
            <p>They are often sliced or used whole in recipes or pressed into olive oil, 
                which is also a major agricultural export in the Mediterranean region. 
                Eating olives whole or using olive oil for certain meals may help protect 
                against various health problems. In addition to this, When you adopt the Mediterranean Diet, olives
                 become an important ingredient to use daily in many diﬀerent ways—on their own as snacks and appetizers, or as 
                 important components in dips, sauces, salads, whole grain and pasta dishes, stews, and even baked goods.</p>
